# Word-frequency-in-Moby-Dick

I used Python's Beautiful Soup package to parse the HTML code to find the words most frequently used in the novel Moby Dick.
I filtered out many of the common words like "the", "a", or "an" (which occur at a high-frequency and would therefore throw off the results) by applying the handy nltk package.
Unsurprisingly the number one most frequent word was "whale" at a count of approximately 1,200. Next, the second most frequent word was "one" at a count of approximately 900. In third place was the word "like" which had a count of 625.
